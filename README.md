# Welcome Geeks

Hello World! Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

# About Me

My name is Jan Lynnel Balitaan and currently residing in the Philippines. I am passionate in software development and have an interest to expand my knowledge in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. I am currently working in the industry since 2017 and doing some freelance job since 2019. I mostly enjoyed working as backend developer and striving to earn more knowledge in the field to help the target audience of every software I am building.
